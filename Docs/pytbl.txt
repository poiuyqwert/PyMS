	Syntax	syntax
Every line of a decompiled TBL file is a string, the only exceptions are emtpy lines, and comments. Comments can be anywhere on a line, and they start with the hash character __#__. For example:
<Code
# This line is not a string because the whole thing is a comment.
Marine<0>#This line (excluding the comment) is a string
>
Also, if you noticed the <0>, PyTBL uses the same string formatting as TBLPad. Special characters can be accessed by putting their ASCII codes in angle brackets __< >__. For example, if you want to have a hash symbol in your string, you must use __<35>__. For a list of usefull ASCII codes, check out the [#cmdline	-r option] on the command line, and the [#reference	Reference] section below.
There are four types of strings:
 +o
 -Regular String
 -Unit String
 -Requirement String
 -Hotkey String
+o
Regular Strings dont really follow a format, they just set the rule for all strings, __all__ strings must end in a <0>:
<Code
string<0>
>
The first 228 strings in the TBL are Unit Strings, and each corrisponds to a unit id (first string is unit id 0, Terran Marine). They are in the form:
<Code
Unit Name<0>Subname<0>StarEdit Group<0>
>
A Requirement String doesn't really follow a format, but the deafult StarCraft format is that every requirement is on its own line, with three spaces for indenting:
<Code
Something1 Requires:<10>   One Requirement<0>
Somethings Require:<10>   Two<10>   Requirements<0>
#  ...
>
Hotkeys are more strict then the other types of strings. The first character is the hotkey character (which includes the Escape key <27> for Cancle buttons), the second is the tooltip type, and the third is the string. There are 6 different types of tooltip:
 +u
 -<0> is usually used on hotkeys that aren't any of the others below
 -<1> is used for units
 -<2> is used for upgrades
 -<3> is used on a button for spell casting
 -<4> is used for technology upgrades
 -<5> is used primarily used on the Guardian and Devourer Aspect on the Mutalisk. It shows the correct mineral and gas cost, but it does not show supply
+u
For example:
<Code
a<0><3>A<1>ttack<0>
m<1>Train <3>M<1>arine<0>
a<2>Upgrade Infantry <3>A<1>rmor<0>
t<3>Psionic S<3>t<1>orm<0>
p<4>Develop <3>P<1>sionic Storm(Templar ability)<0>
d<5><3>D<1>evourer Aspect<0>
