	Syntax	syntax
The syntax of a decompiled LO? file is very simple. There are a bunch of framesets, each started with the header __Frame:__. Under each header (in each frameset), there is a list of overlay coordinates in the form __(<x>, <y>)__. __<x>__ and __<y>__ are both integers in the range -127 to 127, and all framesets must have the same amount of overlays. For example, the Vespene Geyser smoke puff overlay is:
<Code
Frame:
    (11, -19)
    (-40, -13)
    (34, 2)
    (127, 127)
    (127, 127)

Frame:
    (11, -19)
    (-40, -13)
    (34, 2)
    (127, 127)
    (127, 127)

Frame:
    (11, -19)
    (-40, -13)
    (34, 2)
    (127, 127)
    (127, 127)

Frame:
    (11, -19)
    (-40, -13)
    (34, 2)
    (127, 127)
    (127, 127)
