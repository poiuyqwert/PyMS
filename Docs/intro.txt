Introduction
PyMS is an (almost) all inclusive StarCraft Modding Suite, currently containing 13 programs to edit various StarCraft files. Because PyMS uses [http://www.python.org	Python], it works on Windows, Mac, Linux, and many more operating systems.\n__Note:__ This documentation is incomplete and will be updated in the future.
	Changes	changes
+PyMS v1.2.2 (Ongoing)
 -Updated all programs to do atomic writes for all files (writes to a temp file then replaces the existing file with the temp one on completion. Protects your existing files against corruption due to crashes in the writing process)
 -Updated SFmpq.dylib
 -Updated ImageTk importing to support different versions
+PyMS v1.2.1 (June 4, '09)
 -Added __PyMPQ__
 -Updated SFmpq.dll

	Source Installation	install
Once the download is done, unzip PyMS somewhere on your computer. Now to be able to use PyMS from source, you will need to have [http://www.python.org	Python] 2.6+. If you are a Windows user, after installing Python, you will probably have to change your environment variables. One way is to open your Command Prompt and type:
<Command Line
set PATH=%PATH%;C:\Python\
>
__C:\Python\__ is an example isntallation path for Python, make sure you use the actual path to your Python installation.
Finally, as of PyMS v1.1.0, PIL (Python Imaging Library) needs to be installed for the source version to function. You can find it [http://pythonmac.org/packages/py25-fat/index.html	here (Mac)] or [http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/index.htm	here (Windows)].
	Windows EXE Installation	exe
Just extract the PyMS folder somewhere on your computer and run the exe's, thats it.
	Usage	usage
__Note:__ Angle brackets (like <example>) are required parameters (the only exception is if you specify the -h option, no <parameter> is required), square brackets (like [example]) are optional parameters.
All PyMS programs are run practically the exact same way. Start off with opening Command Prompt, and navigating to your PyMS directory. Then to run a program, it is just:
<Command Line
python <program> [options] <parameters>
>
__<program>__ is the program file (like PyGRP.pyw or PyAI.pyw), __[options]__ are program specific flags, and __<parameters>__ are the input and output of the program (usually in the form __<input> [output]__). For more details, check the respective programs documentation, or use the -h option on any program to print a list of options to the command line.
	Bugs	bugs
If one of the programs in PyMS says your file is corrupt, and you don't think it is, or you get a very weird error that looks something like:
<Error
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "PyXXX.pyw", line 6
    def main()
  File "YYY.py", line 1023
    var += blah
         ^
SomeError: some description
>
__Please__ copy down the error, and send it to me along with information and whatever file you were using the program on when it happened (see [#contact	Contact] for contact info).
